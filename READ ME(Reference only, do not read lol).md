 >Sick of approaching your enchanting table only to be presented by the same grey menu as the crafting table? Looking to add some colour into your game? Introducing Colourful Containers! A container GUI replacement mod that hopes to match the menu to every one of Minecraft's colourful interactable blocks!

And now, I present **Colorful Containers Glass**. A pack that every pvper should have! This pack takes original CC, and makes it transparent while keeping the original design.

<p><b>Q: Why are some textures not working?</b><br>
A: Make sure you have either Optifine or OptiGUI (Fabric only) installed.<br>
Some textures like the chestboat only work with OptiGUI due to Optifine's limitations. Lunar Client has Optifine installed but for some reason its not working properly for GUIs.</p>
<p><b>Q: Why are the animations not showing?</b><br>
A: Make sure you have either Optifine or Animatica (Fabric only) installed.</p>
<p><b>Q: Can I add your pack to my modpack?</b><br>
A: Yes, you can add any of my resource packs to your modpack.</p>
<p><b>Q: Something doesn't work!/I have an idea!</b><br>
A: You can report bugs, get help and suggest ideas in the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/b74nSG67">Discord</a> server.</p>

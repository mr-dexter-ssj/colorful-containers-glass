 >Sick of approaching your enchanting table only to be presented by the same grey menu as the crafting table? Looking to add some colour into your game? Introducing Colourful Containers! A container GUI replacement mod that hopes to match the menu to every one of Minecraft's colourful interactable blocks!

And now, I present **Colorful Containers Glass**. A pack that every pvper should have! This pack takes original CC, and makes it transparent while keeping the original design.

<p><b>Q: Why are some textures not working?</b><br>
A: Make sure you have either Optifine or OptiGUI (Fabric only) installed.<br>
Some textures like the chestboat only work with OptiGUI due to Optifine's limitations. Lunar Client has Optifine installed but for some reason its not working properly for GUIs.</p>
<p><b>Q: Why are the animations not showing?</b><br>
A: Make sure you have either Optifine or Animatica (Fabric only) installed.</p>
<p><b>Q: Can I add your pack to my modpack?</b><br>
A: Yes, you can add any of my resource packs to your modpack and distribute it ONLY in CurseForge or Modrinth, as long as you follow the licence rules and give proper credit.</p>
<p><b>Q: Something doesn't work!/I have an idea!</b><br>
A: You can report bugs, get help and suggest ideas in the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/b74nSG67">Discord</a> server (Kingybu's Texture Cave).</p>
